## Core consideration
If you get blocked by a missing specification, feel free to make an assumption, just state what it is.

## Goal
Implement a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to solve the customer needs. By the end of the exercise the customer must have a usable system.

## Problem background
In your first day as developer you are consulting for a customer who owns a textile company named Textile.Co. The company has 1000 employees.

When a new employee joins Textile.Co, the employee receives a new BADGE card imprinted with a unique barcode, each employee has a different BADGE card.

Textile.Co bought a punch card machine that can send a HTTP’s JSON POST payloads to a server and wants to use it to track arrivals and departures of employees. Working hours for employees are from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday to Friday.

The customer wants you to implement the following features:

## Features
1. Your customer wants to be able to see what employees are arriving late.
2. Your customer wants to know what employees are not coming to work at all.
3. Your customer’s employees are complaining that the reported hours for a given period are wrong, so your customer wants to give each of his employees the opportunity to review their current period working hours report 3 days before the paycheck day.

## Extra feature
As soon as you finish and send the MVP we will provide an extra feature and we will implement it with pair programming.

## Hints
Consider using a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).

## Technology
We mostly use tools like GIT, Ruby and Rails. But feel free to use the technology were
you can excel.
